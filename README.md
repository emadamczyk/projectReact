# Bike Your AREA
## ‘Your path to a safer & more efficient (enjoyable) bike commute’

## About our App
This project was created by fellow bicycle enthusiasts tired of hazards and obstructions on our routes while biking around Chicago. Our goal is to provide an app to crowdsource user submissions of obstructions and other issues of concern for bicyclists (crash hazards, theft, etc.)

## To Run on Local Host:
This project was created with Create React App; the setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which is easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
